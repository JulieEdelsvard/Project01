# TravelMate - The Match making app for travellers

## About the project

The TravelMate app has been built as my second project of my Web Development course at General Assembly in Sydney.

## About the app

Are you planning a trip but you do not have a travel partner? TravelMate brings single travellers together, like a match making app for people on the go. Plot in your destination and dates and TravelMate will show you which other adventurers who will be there at the same time.

## Tech / Frameworks used

* HTML
* CSS
* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* PostgreSQL

## API

* Google Maps with pin points

## Approach

The app utilises the model–view–controller (MVC) framework of Rails.

* Models:
  * User
  * Destination
  * Calendar

* Handles data validation:
  * Sign up information - verifying valid email addresses and setting secure passwords.
  * Incorrect inputs are handled through error messages.

* Handles authentication and authorization:
  * Users must be signed in to access app features.
